# Starter Readme

# Git Terminal/CLI Commands to Remember:
## Pushing from alternate branches to the main branch - Git Pull FIRST then Git Push ( this allows you to pull in the most recent changes for the main branch before commiting and pushing any later changes to github)
## 'git prune' command will resolve the 'too many unreachable loos objects' error that may occur

## git commit -m (message_name) - command needed to commit changes to github
## git commit (standard command for commits from terminal)

## 'git add .' (adds all unmerged files at one time)

## 'git add <filename>' (adds a single unmerged file)

## 'git status' (shows the status of the files in the repository)

## 'git push' (pushes the changes to the repository)
